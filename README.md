# Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

The Odin Project - Foundations Course

Project: Rock Paper Scissors solo project revision 1

## Revision 1:

Technologies Used: Javascript

Introduction: We‚Äôre going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic ‚Äúrock paper scissors‚Äù. For the moment we‚Äôre just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don‚Äôt forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‚ÄòLive Preview‚Äô links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don‚Äôt forget to come back and add your link!

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Phew - that was a mission! I started this challenege feeling quite overwhelmed. With not much coding practice, I had to supplement with a free javascript course by scrimba and a few RPS tutorials to try and understand the problem. Many days later, I am happy with the outcome. I can undertand the relation between all the funcytions and how they work, I learnt how to utilise for and while loops and my confidence got a tiny boost.

I am still very much struggling with breaking down the problem, writing pseudocode and understanding Javascript concepts and when to use them. #workinprogress

Onwards and upwards.

## Discord Feedback

Great job üòÑ
In getPlayerChoice if you return in the loop you probably don't need to set playerInput to true.
And in game when incrementing the scores you can just check on Player or Computer given how you send the result.

But these are very minor and this RPS is really good üòÅ
