The Odin Project - Foundations Course

Project: Rock Paper Scissors v2

Technologies Used: Javascript

Introduction: We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!
